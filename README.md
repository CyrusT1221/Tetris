**Tetris Game**

**Overview:**

This project is a Java implementation of the classic Tetris game using Swing for the graphical interface. Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle game where players manipulate falling tetrominoes (geometric shapes composed of four square blocks) to create complete horizontal lines, which disappear and score points.

**Key Features:**
1. **Responsive Controls**: Enjoy smooth gameplay with intuitive controls for moving, rotating, and dropping tetrominoes.
2. **Scoring System**: Track your progress and compete for high scores by clearing lines and achieving milestones.
3. **Hold Feature**: Strategically plan your moves by holding a tetromino for later use, adding a layer of strategy to gameplay.
4. **Next Piece Preview**: Plan ahead by viewing the next tetromino that will appear on the board, allowing for better decision-making.
5. **Shadow Piece**: Visualize the projected landing position of the falling piece with a shadow representation, aiding in positioning and planning future moves.
6. **Game Over and Victory Conditions**: Experience the thrill of victory or the challenge of defeat with clear game over and victory conditions.

**Usage:**
1. **Compile**: Compile the Java files using a Java compiler such as javac.
2. **Run**: Execute the compiled WindowGame class to start the Tetris game.
3. **Controls**: Use the arrow keys for movement, the up arrow for rotation, and the space bar for instant descent. Press Shift to hold a piece.
4. **Objective**: Clear lines by filling horizontal lines with blocks without leaving any gaps.
5. **Scoring**: Accumulate points by clearing lines and aim to achieve the highest score possible.

**Dependencies:**
1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Required for compiling and running Java applications.
2. **Swing Library**: Utilized for creating the graphical user interface components.
3. **Random Library**: Used for generating random tetromino shapes.
